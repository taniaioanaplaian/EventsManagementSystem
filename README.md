# Getting Started
The main purpose of this project is to simplify the process of handling each sport event, class or competitions by providing a web interface for admin, teacher and students as well. The project will be created using Angular for frontend, Spring for backend and MySQL for database management.
The admin part can add the type of sport, competition or class, adding students or teacher and assigning teacher to classes and create a weekly schedule.
The teacher needs to handle all sports related activity assigned by the admin, takes the attendance of students, select winners for each round if there is any competition, award the first three places. Also, teachers should give each student a mark for each activity which is a part of the final mark.
The students can only choose the sport event/competition/class each student wants to attend each week, if there are spots available. Each student can cancel the appointment with at least one day before the class, so other students can attend the activity.
